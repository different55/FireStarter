## How to run
Don't. This script needs to be run in a browser context, in the Browser Toolbox Console. This makes it very dangerous. In order to run this, *at least* one of these two things must be true, preferably both:

1. You trust me with all your heart.
2. You're very familiar with not just JavaScript but Firefox's internal APIs and can verify that this script is harmless.

If at least one of those things isn't true (again, preferably both), you should not run this script or any script from anyone in a browser context. Code run in a browser context is executed as if it was the browser itself, and it is completely unrestricted. It could steal passwords, delete files, anything. If you cannot verify that it is not doing these things, you shouldn't take the risk.
